      repo:
        description: >-
          Repository name with owner (e.g. nextstrain/zika). Defaults to the
          repository of the caller workflow.
        type: string
        default: ${{ github.repository }}
        required: false

      runtime:
        description: >-
          Nextstrain runtime under which to run the build.
          Currently only supports docker, conda, and aws-batch.
          Defaults to "docker".

          The aws-batch runtime requires AWS credentials.  These may come
          directly from secrets or indirectly from assuming a role via GitHub
          Actions' OIDC provider.

          The following secrets are used if present:

          - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
          - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

          They must be defined in the repo's Actions secrets and passed to this
          workflow with `secrets: inherit`.

          If no secrets are present, the GitHubActionsRoleNextstrainBatchJobs
          role is assumed (in both senses of the verb).
        type: string
        default: docker
        required: false

      run:
        description: >-
          The full `nextstrain build` command to run for the build.
          Defaults to `nextstrain build .`

          Use the runtime input to select the runtime for the build instead of
          the runtime selection options to ensure that the runtime is properly
          set up within the GitHub Action job.

          The pathogen repo is cloned to the top level of the working directory
          of the GitHub Action, so use `.` to point to the pathogen repo directory.

          If your build runs longer than the 6 hour limit for a single GitHub
          Action job, then use the aws-batch runtime and the `--detach` flag.
          Subsequent chained jobs will be automatically used to wait on the
          remote build for up to 24 hours total.

          All environment variables provided via the env input and all secrets
          provided via `secrets: inherit` can be passed to the build runtime
          via the `--env` option.  If AWS credentials were acquired by the
          GitHub Action job via role assumption, the following environment
          variables are also available to be passed:

            - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            - AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
        type: string
        default: nextstrain build .
        required: false

      env:
        description: >-
          Environment variables to set for this reusable workflow since
          environment variables in the caller workflow are not propagated to
          reusable workflows. This is expected to be a string containing YAML.

          This is easily produced, for example, by pretending
          you're writing normal nested YAML within a literal multi-line block
          scalar (introduced by "|"):

            with:
              env: |
                FOO: bar
                I_CANT_BELIEVE: "it's not YAML"
                would_you_believe: |
                  it's
                  not
                  yaml

          Do not use for secrets!  Instead, pass them via GitHub Action's
          dedicated secrets mechanism.
        type: string
        default: ""
        required: false

      artifact-name:
        description: >-
          Name to use for the build output artifact uploaded at end of the workflow.

          If you're invoking this workflow multiple times from the same calling
          workflow, you should set this. Otherwise, the default "build-outputs"
          is probably fine.
        type: string
        default: build-outputs
        required: false

      artifact-paths:
        description: >-
          List of paths to include in the build output artifact uploaded
          at the end of the workflow, as a string following the format of the
          `paths` input of the `actions/upload-artifact` action.
          For example:

            with:
              artifact-paths: |
                results/
                auspice/
                logs/

          The default paths included in the artifact are:

            build.log
            auspice/
            results/
            benchmarks/
            logs/
            .snakemake/log/

          The "build.log" contains log messages from the
          `nextstrain build` command.
          The other paths are common output paths for Nextstrain builds.
          If a path does not exist in your build, then the action will still
          succeed and will print out a warning for the non-existent file(s).
          Use an exclude pattern for any of the default paths that you would like to
          exclude from the artifact (e.g. !build.log).

          This is not supported for builds on AWS Batch because the workflow
          detaches from the build. Please use the `nextstrain build` command
          locally to reattach to AWS Batch builds to download outputs.
