name: Setup Nextstrain CLI
description: >-
  This GitHub Actions action is intended to be called by workflows in our other
  repos when they need a working copy of the Nextstrain CLI (the `nextstrain`
  program) installed and don't particularly care about the exact Python
  environment in which its installed.

  For example, this is typically the case when the workflow's primary step
  invokes `nextstrain build` to run a build in a container runtime (locally via
  Docker or remotely via AWS Batch).  Workflows that are more complex (e.g.
  have additional dependencies to install, care about Conda, etc.) should
  probably continue to install the Nextstrain CLI themselves for now.

inputs:
  cli-version:
    description: >-
      Version of Nextstrain CLI to install, as a dependency version spec
      understood by Pip (i.e. conforming to PEP-0508, e.g. >3.2 or ==3.2.4).
      Defaults to none, which means the latest version available will be
      installed.
    type: string
    default: ""
    required: false

  runtime:
    description: >-
      Nextstrain runtime to configure and set as the default, as a string
      understood by `nextstrain setup`.  Defaults to "docker".
    type: string
    default: docker
    required: false

  python-version:
    description: >-
      Version of Python to use for Nextstrain CLI, as a string understood by
      actions/setup-python.  Defaults to "3.9".
    type: string
    default: "3.9"
    required: false
